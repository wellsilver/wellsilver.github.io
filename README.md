# wellsilver.github.io

This is a personal site I use for all sorts of things, its pretty basic.


# Incoming updates:

Im working on (in the development branch) a cleaner UI with the capability of giving even more
yes, I know the art page is missing I dont have anything to put there and im too lazy to make one
Im gonna get a forum in too but that will be after v2

# Some info:

Im probably going to make websites for a few other family members as well.
the site is hosted via github's pages so there you go.
I might switch the site to the experimental branch to see how github handles it
